As part of my ongoing efforts to broaden my horizons as a developer <del>and stave off the haunting spectre of Imposter Syndrome</del>
I've decided to branch out a bit by rebuilding my website using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) instead of using and therefore indirectly endorsing Wordpress.

I expect that Jekyll will serve my needs without requiring the support of a bloated CMS of questionable code quality. As with my
previous website, expect me to publish three, perhaps *even four* posts per year!

Once I get around to assigning categories to things, I'll probably post them here. In the mean time, check out my [professional twitter account](https://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter_username }}) or my [Github](http://github.com/{{ site.github_username }})!
